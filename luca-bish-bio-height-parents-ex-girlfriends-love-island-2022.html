The line-up has many interesting contestants this year.</p><p>For the first time ever, viewers also play a significant role besides watching the show for fun. Now, they can vote on which contestant to move forward to the next round and who they think should couple up as a new Love Island twist in season 8.</p><p>Luca Bish is one of the contestants confirmed in the new line-up for season 8. Joining her on this interesting journey are model and dancer Tasha Ghouri, a student Liam Llewellyn from South Wales, Waitress and model Indiyah Polack, London-based nanny <a href=#>Amber Beckford</a>, Real Estate Agent Andrew Le Page, Pharmaceutical Sales Ikenna Ekwonna, business owner Gemma Owen, another business owner from Rome Italy Davide Sanclimenti, Paramedic Paige Thorne, and Senior Microbiologist Dami Hope are among the confirmed casts.</p><p>Whereas, Joshua Legrove, Jordan Spencer, Kat Harrison, Brad McDermott, Sophie Draper, and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu are rumored contestants on the show.</p><p>From hereon you’ll learn about his parents, age, birthday, height, and job.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> EastEnders’ Patsy Palmer is a family friend of Luca.</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish On Love Island 2022</strong></h3><p>Luca Bish was inspired by former Love Island couples so he applied for the competition to genuinely look for love in the show. He hoped he’ll be as successful as former Love Island couples on the show, saying: “When you actually look back at Love Island, you can see how many couples it’s genuinely made. I don’t know how many kids Love Island has made but there are a few, aren’t there?”</p><p>“I was enjoying being in a relationship, there were just things I didn’t like and we drifted apart,” Luca said. He added that he preferred to meet potential partners when he was out and about in Love Island 2022.</p><p>“I think when you go looking for it, it’s not as easy though, it’s like you’re too desperate for it,” Luca said. “If I think you’re the one or I like you, I’ll take you out on a date but other than that, if we talk and I don’t like where it’s going – then I won’t be throwing out dates”.</p><p>In the show, Luca’s tattoos have already become a topic of conversation amongst fans.</p><p>Luca was coupled with Paige Thorne, a paramedic from Swansea. He reveals to Paige that his favorite sex position is ‘oyster’.</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish Ex-Girlfriends</strong></h3><p>While revealing his tattoos, Luca Bish opened up about his girlfriend. Viewers compared the tattoos to pop star Harry Styles. He explained, “My ex was a tattoo artist so I was a bit like her coloring-in book. I was going, ‘Go on then”. “But yeah, it’s probably the best thing I’ll ever get compared to Harry Styles at. They’re just very random. I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of meaning for a lot of them but they’re there now”.</p><p>That person was probably his last girlfriend who he dated for 4 years.</p><p>Luca also dated Strictly Come Dancing star and YouTuber Saffron Barker before stepping into the villa. He told Metro.co.uk, that he and Saffron dated for a few months around six months to a year ago, explaining that they initially met through friends. “We used to go to the same school in Brighton,” he said, recollecting how on one occasion, they went out as a group – and he and Saffron were both singles at the time.</p><p>“I think she had just come out of a relationship. And then yeah, that was it. We just kind of hit the ground running a bit. We still remain really good mates,” Luca said. The pair reportedly spoke last almost a month or two before. Saffron has “a very busy lifestyle” and his work as a fishmonger meant that he often works at night when asked why their relationship didn’t work out.</p><p>Luca dished, “I see her as a good friend”.</p><p>Moreover, he also revealed that since he was 16, he has never gone longer than 10 weeks without se*. Luca told how he would happily back out of doing the show if it meant he could date former contestant Maura Higgins.</p><p>Luca told, “Maura! If she likes a younger boy, I’ll sack this off right now! Everything about her – the face, the fieriness, the Irish accent. She’s got it all”.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Luca Bish Dating Today?</strong></h3><p>Based on the social media post, Luca Bish is single today. But, updates on his relationship are expected to update after the end of the show. His Facebook relationship status currently reveals that he is single.</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish Age</strong></h3><p>In 2022, at the time of the filming, Luca Bish was 23 years old.</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish Parents</strong></h3><p>Luca Bish was born to his mother Maria Bish Gisonni. However, there is nothing available about his father except for the fact that he is also in the fish business. After the official announcement of the show, Maria posted on Brighton People’s Facebook Page. She wrote, “<span>Brighton boy Luca will be entering the Love Island Villa this evening at 21:00 ITV2. Hope you are able to show your support, you can follow him on Instagram for updates @Luca Bish </span><span>Bring the love home, Luca”.</span></p><p>She added, “<span>Vote for free by downloading the Love Island app. </span><span>Thank you for your support </span><span>(Luca’s Mum)”. </span>Apparently, Maria is the owner of <a href=#>Duches Rose Antiques</a> who also shared about her son on the business page.</p><p>Luca Bish also has a sister who is taking care of the social media posts.</p><h3><strong>Is Luca Bish On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Luca Bish is available on Instagram (<a href=#>@lucabish</a>) and Facebook (<a href=#>@lucabishx</a>).</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish Job</strong></h3><p>Luca Bish has a job as a fishmonger. He shared that he had no interest in becoming famous and would get back to his fishmonger job after the show.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: “I don’t really care about being famous. If I end up back in the fish market tomorrow, I was happy then and I’ll be happy after. I’m not really too fussed, but whatever happens, happens. And if I end up back at the fish market selling fish with my dad, then I end up there”.</p><p>According to Glassdoor, Fishmonger earns £11 an hour.</p><h3><strong>Luca Bish Height</strong></h3><p>Though Luca Bish stands tall above 6 feet, his tattoos became the center of attention in the show.</p><p>Luca was asked about any tattoos that he didn’t like. Luca said, “I don’t like [my left] arm. This has got a lion on so people are comparing me to Harry Styles – I think nine times out of 10 people with tattoos have got a bloody lion on.”</p><p>Luca continued: “[My right] arm I like a bit more. It’s got Einstein, Amy Winehouse, Muhammad Ali, and Winston Churchill. There’s a bit more meaning there but all the others I’m a bit of a coloring-in book”.</p><p>“This year, for the first year ever, we want you guys at home to play Cupid and you will have your say on which boy couples up with which girl,” Luca said on Lorraine on Friday.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Luca Bish Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Luca Bish’s birthday is yet to reveal.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Luca Bish From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Luca Bish is originally from <span class=nc684nl6>Brighton and Hove.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpa2TlnqjtdKhZJuhn2K1prXGoatmqJGnsq%2FA0macsWWXnr%2BtstGinKeco2K5sMLEZqCspJGjsW5%2Bj2tpaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ross-bagdasarian-jr.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ross Bagdasarian Jr Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meadow-walker-siblings-brother-parents-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fast X Meadow Walker Siblings: How Many Brother Does She Have?
