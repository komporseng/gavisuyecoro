In that pile of precious intel was a photo of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) with the Vietnamese woman (Porter Duong) whom we met briefly in last week’s episode, and Kevin noticed that she was wearing the necklace that Jack had given him.</p><p>Next, How did the Pearsons find out about Nicky?</p><p>In season 3 of This Is Us, Kevin Pearson discovers that his Uncle Nicky did not die in the war while traveling in Vietnam. When Kevin returns home, he and his siblings take a trip to find their long lost Uncle. The truth comes out via flashbacks about what happened between Nicky and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia).</p><p>Did Jack know Nicky was alive? That’s when Kevin put two and two together, when he noticed the postcard was postmarked 1992, 17 years after the end of the Vietnam War, and the exact moment he knew Jack was well aware that Nicky was alive.</p><p>Regarding this, How did Kevin find Uncle Nicky? Then in season 3, Kevin (Justin Hartley) discovered a post-war postcard from Nicky to Jack and the Big Three discovered that their uncle, who was struggling with alcoholism and PTSD, was in fact alive and living in an old trailer in Bradford, Pennsylvania, where he still lives.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Jack_have_a_kid_in_Vietnam></span><strong>Did Jack have a kid in Vietnam?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the time, Jack had told his son that “someone very special” had given it to him in Vietnam during a very low point in his life, though he didn’t specify who this person was. Originally, some may have assumed it had belonged to his brother, but we now know that was not the case.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Kevin_go_to_Vietnam></span><strong>Why did Kevin go to Vietnam?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the present, Kevin and Zoe have embarked on an excursion to Vietnam, believing they can find answers about the mysterious local woman in a photograph with Jack, and the necklace that he kept from that era.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_Nick_Pearson></span><strong>What happened to Nick Pearson?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An old Nicky Pearson is alive and well and living in Bradford, PA, about 150 miles from the Pearson homebase of Pittsburgh.

Nicky originally wanted nothing to do with him (the boy’s mother is the mysterious Vietnamese woman, Hien), but the kid won him over, so the two went out on an adventure. One of the grenades exploded on the boat, and the boy died.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Cassidy_in_This_Is_Us></span><strong>Who is Cassidy in This Is Us?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Morrison plays Cassidy in ‘This Is Us’</p><p>This Is Us introduced Jennifer Morrison as Cassidy Sharp to fans during the season 4 premiere, “Strangers.” As was the case with all of the new characters during the hour, she had a surprise connection to the Pearson family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Kate_and_Toby_get_divorced></span><strong>Do Kate and Toby get divorced?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Viewers have known that Kate winds up with Phillip, but this episode chronicled how they got together, starting with them enjoying a drink the day Kate and Toby finalized their divorce and a first date in which Philip explained how he was married and the relationship went bad when they couldn’t have kids.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Randall_and_Beth_divorce_on_This_Is_Us></span><strong>Do Randall and Beth divorce on This Is Us?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Randall and wife Beth’s (Susan Kelechi Watson) relationship isn’t in trouble, but their bond will continue to evolve throughout the show’s final season. “I think you’re going to get to see Randall in full color — really centered and balanced and being there to support his family,” Fogelman says.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_was_Nicky_in_This_Is_Us></span><strong>Where was Nicky in This Is Us?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At this point, Nicky was believed to have returned from Vietnam but was laying low under the premise that he had died abroad.

Though Kevin assumed this necklace had some significance to Jack and his mystery woman, it seems like it’s just a dime a dozen in Vietnam. At one point, we see the woman take one off the neck of a fallen soldier.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Kevin_get_Jack%E2%80%99s_necklace_back></span><strong>How did Kevin get Jack’s necklace back?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trying to help his son cope with the news that he won’t play football again, Jack brings up his necklace and tells Kevin that he got it during “a very hopeless time in my life.” “Someone very special gave it back to me in Vietnam,” he reveals to him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_episode_does_Nicky_appear_This_Is_Us></span><strong>What episode does Nicky appear This Is Us?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The episode, “Lovebirds,” juxtaposed two road trips: Nicky, joined by Rebecca and Miguel, drove to see his long-lost love, Sally, for whom he had been pining for decades.
