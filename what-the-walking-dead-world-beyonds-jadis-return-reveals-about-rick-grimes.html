Pertinently, Jadis recalls the circumstances that brought her into the CR—which she confirms was six years ago, delivering a definitive timeline declaration for <strong>World Beyond</strong>. After Huck identifies her as “a rescue,” Jadis recounts, “I was living by my wits in the wilderness. I created a little society quite quickly.” While she mourns her society of Scavengers, she cites the experience of losing them as a valuable lesson about making “the wrong alliances,” alluding to how they were slaughtered by the Saviors during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Out War</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, despite the surname tribute, this line seemingly reveals how six years of apparent CRM indoctrination changed Jadis’s perspective on siding with Alexandria—and Rick—during that bygone conflict. The vague suggestion would serve as a pertinent preamble to <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a></strong> Universe’s first update on the fate of Rick Grimes. “I had an opportunity, and I created a ticket to get into the Civic Republic,” says Jadis. “I gave the CRM something very valuable and I got a new life.” While Rick is not mentioned by name, the story she’s describing clearly aligns with the aforementioned mothership show events, which occurred in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Walking Dead</strong> Season 9, Episode 5, “What Comes After.”</a> However, her classification of Rick as “something very valuable” to the CRM is profound, since it qualifies his designation of “B” as being an asset in which the organization is invested, rather than a disposable test subject for their post-mortem experiments, who are likely the “A’s.” Thusly, we can conclude that, six years later, Rick is still safely stowed away by the CRM for some greater purpose.</p><p>Interestingly, Jadis’s subsequent lines—focused on her newfound purpose in the CR—seems to carry nuance that could prove pertinent to the Rick angle. While she clearly declares her loyalty, stating, “It’s not just about moving up. I know that the Civic Republic is the last light of the world. My purpose is to create a new era on this planet,” Huck calls out the Kool-Aid-drunk drivel by responding, “The way you keep saying it makes me wonder if you believe it.” While one might chalk that up to the underlying tension between the two—since Huck believes herself to be the subject of Jadis’s investigation—it could also be the case that Jadis’s loud ambition hides a secret agenda, one that could prove potent to the eventual plot of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Grimes movies</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>For now, even the most minor detail of said plot remains a mystery, and the movie projects—once eyed in a pre-pandemic world for theatrical releases—are currently resting in pre-production purgatory. Nevertheless, Jadis’s <strong>World Beyond</strong> arrival will certainly stoke existing speculation. In fact, it arguably bolsters theories about a mentioned but never-seen character on the spinoff named Major General Beale, a shadowy higher-up on the CRM totem pole who even outranks designated big bad Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth Kubrek (Julia Ormond). Her status as Huck’s tough-love-instilling mother lends an intriguing political layer to Jadis’s investigation, since it’s possibly occurring under Beale’s orders. Yet, with <strong>World Beyond</strong> imminently ending its limited run, the belief is that Beale’s eventual onscreen arrival will reveal the main villain of the Rick movies, further teasing the features. However, some of the more out-there theories even claim that Beale—in a surprise twist—will be revealed as Rick himself, possibly serving the CRM under the influence of brainwashing or memory loss from his injuries!</p><p>We’ll just have to keep watching <strong>The Walking Dead: World Beyond</strong> Sundays on AMC to see if any more morsels manifest about Rick’s fate. The second and final season is already past the halfway point of its 10-episode frame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOsJ%2BarF2ptaZ51pqjpKGenHqlscCdZLCnoqGxbq7EsqannKNit6KwyKxkq52kqr%2BvedGerZ6ZnKh6oq7OrqtmqpmYuG6z0aKknqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brooks-edmund-hardie-and-explore-the-unfolding-story-of-brooks-edmund-hardie-in-georgia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>brooks edmund hardie and Explore the unfolding story of Brooks Edmund Hardie in Georgia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vielka-valenzuela.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vielka Valenzuela</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
