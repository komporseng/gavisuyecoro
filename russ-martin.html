In 1982, KTLR 107.1 FM in Terrell, Texas, hired him to broadcast country music on weekends. KAAM 1310 AM in Dallas hired him as a part-time weekend radio jockey in 1983.</p><p>In 1986, he was hired part-time by the Satellite Music Network for an oldies format, and he later worked part-time for Z-Rock while still working at KAAM and KAFM. In 1987, he was hired by Dallas’ top 40 station, KEGL, The Eagle. On KEGL on Sunday nights, he hosted a talk show. From 1988 to 1994, he hosted the local FOX station KDAF’s television shows Hot TV and Hot Tickets.</p><p>Following the departure of The Howard Stern Show from KEGL, The Russ Martin Show debuted in its first incarnation. In 1997, he was asked to take over the morning drive position. Within two years, Russ’ ratings surpassed those of legendary Dallas radio personality Ron Chapman. He left KEGL in 2000 due to a contract dispute. KYNG, a country-western radio station, reintroduced The Russ Martin Show. On April 6, 2000, he began his first show at KYNG, resuming his morning drive time slot.</p><p>Since his debut on 105.3, The Russ Martin Show has consistently maintained high ratings for KLLI. In August 2005, D Magazine named him the best radio talk show host in the DFW area. When Live 105.3 changed its format to include more live sports programming in December 2008, he was fired. On July 1, 2010, KEGL aired a promo announcing the return of The Russ Martin Show. Furthermore, on September 14, 2011, KEGL began airing The Russ Martin Show’s best-of-episodes for an extended period of time during the show’s daypart.

The Foundation organizes the Heroes Day Parade each year. In 2006, the Russ Martin Show Experience, a band comprised of RMS cast members, regular guests, and local artists, was formed. Every year, the band performs rock cover songs live and at a charity “White Trash Party.”</p><h2>Russ Martin Net Worth And Award</h2><p>He received no awards or recognition for his work until his death.
