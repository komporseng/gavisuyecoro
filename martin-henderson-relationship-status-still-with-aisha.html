The New Zealand actor was left “practically concussed” after a stunt he decided to do himself went terribly wrong.</p><p>Although the Grey’s Anatomy actor is all fine now, he’s already said that he will never do any stunts himself in the future. Today, we are going to have a look at his relationship status — how many kids he has and whether or not he is still together with lifestyle blogger and travel junkie <a href=#>Aisha Mendez</a>.</p><h3><strong>Martin Henderson Relationship Status: Is He Still With Aisha Mendez?</strong></h3><p>Everyone who follows Martin Henderson on social media knows that the actor does not shy away from his love life publicly. But, lately, Martin has only uploaded pictures from his professional life — like movie premieres and stuff. Does that mean he has already broken up with his quarantine love?</p><p>Martin and Aisha began dating during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns and were even quarantined together. He first teased a picture of Aisha Mendez to his fans and followers on April 29, 2020.

The adorable duo featured each other a lot of times on social media, and Martin often praised his lady’s sense of humor too.</p><p>However, it looks like their lockdown bond was not too strong to keep them together. As per Country Living, Martin and Aisha broke up in early 2022.</p><p>Since then, The Ring actor has deleted all of his and Aisha’s pictures from his Instagram account.</p><p>In case you did not know, Martin Henderson previously dated G.I. Jane actress Demi Moore.

Although Martin did not react to the news at that time, in 2014, he told the Sunday Herald Sun it was not fun having their move tracked. He also shared that he felt for Demi.</p><p>Martin is currently romancing Alexandra Breckenridge on screen. Leaving Grey’s Anatomy in 2017, Martin landed the main role of Jack Sheridan, a bar owner, and love interest for protagonist Melinda “Mel” Monroe, played by This Is Us actress Alexandra Breckenridge, in the Netflix show Virgin River.</p><p>Talking about his on-screen chemistry with This Is Us actress Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin said, “We’re blessed with the fact that Alex and I have good chemistry. That’s really evident, and it’s not something you can always count on, unfortunately. It’s either there, or it’s not, and we have it, so it allows us to work in a way that is respectful of one another,” to TV Line in 2020.</p><p>While the duo has an undeniably good on-screen chemistry, they never dated each other. In fact, Alexandra married Katy Perry’s drummer Casey Hooper in 2015. They shared two kids together, a four-year-old son named Jack and a three-year-old daughter, Billie.</p><h3><strong>Does Martin Henderson Have Children?</strong></h3><p>Although Martin Henderson has dated many women over the years, he never really married anyone.

In a recent post, he shared a close-up shot of his doggy on the beach and gushed: ‘I love him so much. Even when he gets coated in fine sand and leaves it ALL over the boat.’</p><h3><strong>Martin Henderson Young</strong></h3><p>Martin Henderson does not look much different when compared to his young photos.
