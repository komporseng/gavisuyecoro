When they turned the corner onto Oakwood Road, Cordova allegedly stopped the SUV and retrieved a long knife from the trunk.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Cordova then opened the passenger side door and began stabbing Cisneros repeatedly. When the victim’s wife tried to intervene, Cordova allegedly began slashing and stabbing her.</p><p>The attack finally ended when several passing drivers stopped and subdued Cordova until Suffolk County Police arrived. Officers reportedly found the knife used in the attacks at the scene.</p><p>Cisneros suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck and body, and was pronounced dead at the scene, prosecutors said. His wife was taken to Huntington Hospital for treatment of her wounds.</p><p>“This defendant allegedly murdered his friend and was savagely attacking his friend’s wife when she tried to save her husband’s life,” Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our thoughts are with the Cisneros family as we prosecute this defendant for this horrendous crime.”</p><p>Cordova was arraigned on a second-degree murder charge in Suffolk County Court on Friday, Feb. 17. He pleaded not guilty and was ordered held at the Suffolk County jail.</p><p>Investigators are still working to determine a motive in the killing.</p><p>Cordova is scheduled to appear back in court on Monday, March 6.&nbsp;</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Suffolk and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBksqeioHy0wcWfpqWjX6OyuL%2BOn6minZ6ZerTAwJuqZqClo8Gqusatpqdlo6mutbXOp2SmmZ5iwbB5w56YraBdqLmiv8eeqmaumZjBqrnSZq6inpVixKmxzWaqoZ1dqb%2BqsdJmq6hlmJq5sXnDmmZxbWdlgXh7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-mccarthy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan McCarthy- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-henry-nargeolet-net-worth-2023-earning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Titanic Submersible Paul Henry Nargeolet Net Worth 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
