David Sedaris was born in Binghamton, New York, in 1956.

Sedaris was reading a diary that he had kept since 1977. Glass was so impressed with his work that he asked him to appear on his weekly local show, The Wild Room. Referring to the chance, Sedaris said, “I owe everything I have to Ira… My life just changed completely, as if someone waved a magic wand.” Sedaris’s success on The Wild Room led to his first appearance on National Public Radio on December 23, 1992, when he read a radio essay on Morning Edition titled “Santaland Diaries,” in which he wrote about his supposed experiences as an elf at Macy’s department store in New York during Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.fresherslive.com/latestnews/images/articles/origin/2022/10/31/david-sedaris-net-worth-2022-age-height-and-more-635f97beceef1-1667209150.jpg><p>“Santaland Diaries” was a hit with listeners and made Sedaris what The New York Times called “a minor event.” He started recording a monthly segment for NPR that was based on his diary entries and was edited and produced by Glass. He also signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown, and Company. Sedaris told The New York Times in 1993 that he was publishing his first book, a collection of stories and essays, and that he had 70 pages written of his second book, a novel “about a man who keeps a diary and whom Mr. Sedaris described as “not me, but a lot like me.”</p><h2><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Sedaris lives in Rackham, West Sussex, England, with his longtime partner, the painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick. Sedaris mentions Hamrick in a number of his stories and says that the two of them are “the kind of couple who wouldn’t get married.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141202_2831981_david_sedaris_will_scold_you_for_wearing_che.jpg><p>Sedaris is known to frequently wear a headlamp at night and spend hours picking up trash on roads and highways near Rackham.
