Reigns, who is a professional WWE wrestler tied the knot to his high school sweetheart, Galina Becker. Much like Reigns, Becker is a fitness enthusiast. She played track and field throughout high school and also in college, and tried her hand at volleyball for a single season. And while Becker has put her career on hold to take care of her children, she remains active as usual. But unlike Reigns, who is one of the most popular wrestlers on the planet, not much is known about Becker. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Galina Becker.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Galina Joelle Becker was born on the 11th of March 1987, in Jacksonville, Florida. Born to Mildred and Kevin Becker, Becker has a younger sister,&nbsp; Kristal, who is currently living in New Zealand. As a young kid, Becker spent most of her early life helping Kristal get through her early diseases. She has been quite vocal about her sister’s illness who was diagnosed at the age of 5 and took 6 years to fully recover. Not the only two kids in the family, Becker also has two older sisters, Undine and Molisa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Galina-Becker-husband-Roman-Reigns.jpg><p>On the educational side of things, Becker graduated in 2005 from Mt.

While she was in high school, Becker was heavily involved in track and field and continued her exploits on the field at the Georgia Institute of Technology. During her time at University, Becker nabbed the winning spots for the triple jump, hurdles, and the 100-meter dash.

While at college, Becker also tried her hand at Volleyball for a single season but left the sport after not experiencing much success.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating from college, Becker worked as a fitness model for a short while before tying the knot with Roman Reigns.

The pair had their first child, Joelle Anoa’i, in June 2008 and tied the knot much later in December of 2014. The pair wanted their daughter to feel a part of their wedding, so the entire ceremony was held during a Disney Cruise at Castaway Cay, an island in the Bahamas owned and operated by Walt Disney.</p><p>Becker is currently married to WWE fighter, Roman Reigns.
