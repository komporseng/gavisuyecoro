hungry.</p><p>A Canadian nature lover’s attempt to capture wildlife on camera backfired terrifyingly after she inadvertently documented what appeared to be “naked witches eating a carcass” at night right by her house.</p><p>Social media posts depicting the alleged deer-crunching coven are currently blowing up online, with viewers speculating the nighttime noshers were conducting some sort of satanic ritual.</p><p>“I don’t know what the heck was up with that,” Corinea Stanhope, 36, told Kennedy News of the spine-tingling sight. “It really freaked us out, it’s not something you see every day.”</p><p>The Powell River native had reportedly been riding one of her horses when she came across a dead deer in her garden.</p><p>While most might’ve turned their nose up at the sight, the mother of three and her grandpa Bob, 76, decided to set up a camera to see if the carcass would attract any critters at night.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Canadian nature lover Corinea Stanhope, 36, attempted to capture nocturnal wildlife on camera, only to inadvertently document what appeared to be “naked witches eating a carcass” at night right by her house.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">One of the “witches” appears to bite the dead deer’s hoof in the chilling footage. <span class=credit>Kennedy News &

Media</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Maybe they were paying their respects but they were naked,” said Stanhope. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>“Me and my grandpa put up a trail camera to see if we could see animals and we got a bobcat [on camera], which was pretty cool,” the Canuck described.</p><p>Little did she know, that wasn’t the only bloodthirsty beast they would catch on camera. “I came the next day and grandpa said he’d got naked people on the camera and I said ‘no you didn’t … bulls–t’ so he showed me,” Stanhope recalled.</p><p>The bone-chilling photos, taken just after sunset, showed two “disheveled”-looking women with long black hair obscuring their faces squatting over the dead deer and appearing to dine on its remains like something out of the 2014 horror flick “The Witch.”</p><p>The wicked hungry pair is completely naked except for what looks like loin cloths over their netherregions in the found footage horror film-esque scene.</p><p>“It looks like they have wigs on,” described Stanhope. “One looks like she has blonde hair underneath.”</p><p>She added, “You can’t really tell from the photos but the hoof was brought right up to her mouth.”</p><p>The aghast gal said she wasn’t sure if the so-called witches of beast-wick were “kissing it, smelling or eating it” but was nonetheless sickened by the ritual given the “the amount of bacteria” that was potentially on the “decaying carcass.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“There’s rumors around town about a cult that collects animal bones,” said Stanhope. “I don’t know if it’s real or not.” <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Stanhope said she was especially “creeped” out because the impromptu carrion cuddling session occurred only two minutes from her house.</p><p>“I was concerned about them messing with my horses at night,” the medical practitioner said. “The horses always get really spooked and unnerved around that area.”</p><p>She added, “I thought they imagined stuff at first so I didn’t think anything of it. Maybe I believe them now.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope’s camera did catch a bobcat eating the deer carcass. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Social media seemed convinced that the Canadian had witnessed witches, a local cult or some other malevolent entity performing a demonic ritual.</p><p>“This is actually terrifying,” commented one viewer, while another posited, “That’s a skinwalker, they look ‘human’ so you come up to them and once you do you’re gone.”</p><p>“That’s basically a walking demon from hell,” theorized a third. “If you hear screaming stay inside and get a gun you leave it alone.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope and her daughter Ashtyn, 15. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>One occult lover even postulated that the barenaked ladies were wendigos, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native American spirits </a>who possess people and turn them into cannibals.</p><p>“This creature has long been known among the Algonquian&nbsp;Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Saulteaux, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu peoples,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reads their description on Legends of America</a>. “They have described them as giants, many times larger than human beings.”</p><p>They added, “Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being strongly associated with winter, the north, coldness, famine, and starvation.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Commenters had their own theories about who the mysterious carcass munchers were. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Some commenters suggested they were part of some demonic cult, according to Stanhope.</p><p>“There’s rumors around town about a cult that collects animal bones. I don’t know if it’s real or not,” she said. “Some people have mentioned it since I posted the photos. A friend said they came across two people in the woods carrying some dead squirrels.”</p><p>A few concerned viewers even urged Stanhope to call the police, which she said she was tempted to do before her grandpa Bob pointed out that the duo wasn’t doing anything “illegal technically.”</p><p>“He was pretty mortified,” said the woman, who hopes that the deer diners were simply pulling a prank.</p><p>“I’m hoping they went for a walk in the day, saw the trail cam was set up and wanted to have a bit of fun with us or they’re on some good drugs,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The horses always get really spooked and unnerved around that area,” said Stanhope. “I thought they imagined stuff at first so I didn’t think anything of it. Maybe I believe them now.” <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Many social media commenters supported this theory, citing Stanhope’s aforementioned observation that the so-called “witches” had long blonde hair under their wild raven wigs.</p><p>Either way, perhaps these “The Craft” cosplayers should consider moving to New York, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">named the best city for witches in 2021</a>, according&nbsp;to a study by Lawn Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maW1fqMG2us2em2ampafApnnCmqucoJWoeqSt0ZyYrKtdmq61tc2gZLChpJi1pr%2BMqKVmq5WYwrO107JknJmdmr%2Biew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-rivera.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Rivera</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spit-up-move.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spit Up (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
