She didn’t want to do it without me. Therefore, I don’t want to do it without her and that should be fairly clear,” she recalled saying.</p><p><strong>For more Page Six you love …</strong></p><p>According to Combs, Levin responded to her ultimatum with what “felt like blackmail” as he threatened to sue her if she quit.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She recalled finding out about the news in an emotional meeting with show producer Jonathan Levin. <span class=credit>©Viacom/Courtesy Everett Collect</span></figure><p>Doherty’s character, Prue Halliwell, was killed off in the Season 3 finale in 2001, and she was later replaced by Rose McGowan’s character, Paige.</p><p>The “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum recalled the pain and confusion she felt after getting fired.</p><p>“I lived a year after that sort of replaying everything in my brain and really trying to find those moments [of alleged bad behavior on set] — and I couldn’t find them,” said Doherty, 52.</p><p>“I don’t ever remember being mean to her on set. I remember an episode I directed where she did something on the Christmas break and they asked me to work around some things with her and I had no problem with it. I couldn’t have been more kind and understanding,” Doherty continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">“We’ve been backed into this corner — we’re basically in this position where it’s one or the other,” Combs recalled Levin telling her. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The “Heathers” star — who was 30 when she left the show — said she wishes she had been “older and wiser” enough to handle the situation differently.</p><p>“I definitely would’ve sued and I would’ve been honest about the situation because the rumors followed me regardless,” she said.</p><p>While Doherty has moved on with her life, she still hasn’t forgiven and forgotten.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The actress added that Milano built her case by documenting “every time she felt uncomfortable on set.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“As you get older, you accept that a situation happened. Acceptance and moving on with your life does not equate to forgiveness,” the podcaster continued. “You just learn a lesson and look at somebody differently and move on.”</p><p>Reps for Milano weren’t immediately available to Page Six for a comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Doherty initially opened up about her strained relationship with Milano, 50, during part one of the podcast episode with Combs last week.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Combs allegedly even threatened to leave the show in retaliation but was allegedly told she would be sued. <span class=credit>GJimenez</span></figure><p>Doherty claimed she was<a href=#> prevented from visiting Combs in the hospital</a> in the late 1990s by the “Who’s the Boss” star and her mom.</p><p>“Hospitals scared me to death. I waited 24 hours after your surgery to go, and then it wasn’t even easy for me to get in. I was, like, being told I couldn’t even get in,” Doherty recalled.</p><p>“Alyssa and her mom were blocking people from seeing you, and at the time you didn’t know. I remember you texted me, ‘Dude, are you going to come and see me?’”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Doherty couldn’t recall treating Milano poorly while on set. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Hallmark Channel</span></figure><p>Milano has since admitted she regrets how she treated Doherty and&nbsp;<a href=#>lives with “guilt”</a>&nbsp;from the past.</p><p>“You know, I could take responsibility for a lot of our tension that we had,” she told E!’s “Daily Pop” in 2017, adding she was in <a href=#>communication with her former co-star</a> at the time.</p><p>“I think a lot of our struggle came from feeling that I was in competition rather than it being that sisterhood that the show was so much about. And I have some guilt about my part in that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmppaGloZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COoaalpKliuqK%2ByJ5knKedl8Bur86nnaKqnah6orjYrKqaZZ2euaK6zmafmpxdqLWius2epWacn52ys8DYZp2iqpWZeqe%2BzqZknKCRp7qmsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jsu-canvas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JSU Canvas Login 2024 | Jackson State University</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cristina-neros.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cristina Neros- Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
