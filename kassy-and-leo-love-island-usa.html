We get to see the ups and downs in the lives of many of these couples in the recently released fifth season, including Kassandra “Kassy” Castillo and Leonardo “Leo” Dionicio, whose relationship was anything but easy and kept the viewers on the edge of their seats constantly wondering what they might do next. But have they kept up their romance away from the villa? Here is what we do know about it, though!</p><h3>Kassy and Leo’s Love Island USA Journey Together</h3><p>On Day 1 of the Peacock show, Kassandra “Kassy” Castillo and Leonardo “Leo” Dionicio both entered and were paired with one another. However, not long after, the latter noticed himself drawn to Anna Kurdys, which left Kassy angry. As a result, the two made the decision to cease investigating their relationship, and by the time of the subsequent recoupling ceremony, Leo had been coupled with Anna and Kassy had become engaged to Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/KL-2-1.jpg alt="love island usa season 5,carmen love island usa,kassy love island usa,hannah love island usa,kassy and leo love island still together,kassy love island usa age,leo and kassy love island instagram,bergie and taylor love island,kassy and leo love island usa instagram,kassy and leo love island usa age,kassy and leo love island usa instagram account,kassy and leo love island usa instagram id,kassy and leo love island usa season 4,*kassy and leo love island usa,leo and ish kiss,leo loves kate" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kassy soon admitted to Keenan Anunay that she was intrigued by him, but that specific attraction did not develop into something more. Soon, Kassy and Leo began to lean towards one another, and Anna was devastated when she unintentionally overheard them discussing perhaps restarting their relationship. By the second recoupling ceremony, Kassy and Leo had reconciled after some unavoidable conflict.</p><p>Kassy and Leo’s relationship deteriorated after they split up after the former moved to Casa Amor. They did not hesitate to look into other connections, despite their initial assertion that they were exclusively interested in each other. Leo was becoming close to Johnnie Garcia, while Kassy watched a goon link form between herself and Matia Marcantuoni. In truth, the latter two did end up sleeping together, which caused Leo to doubt his relationship with Kassy.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uf47d39f58ceb2420f338f9a9f5cc24a2><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Imani and Zay: Are They Still Together After Love Island USA?</span></a><p>Leo ultimately decided to pair up with Johnnie during the recoupling ceremony that followed Casa Amor, and Kassy returned with Matia. She admitted that she had a sneaking suspicion that she had truly slept with Leo but had wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt when she saw Johnny talking about sleeping with someone in the video that the Casa Amor inmates had obtained. She said she was done with Leo because of the obvious contempt he had shown her by having a sexual relationship with someone else.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/KL-1-1.jpg alt="love island usa season 5,carmen love island usa,kassy love island usa,hannah love island usa,kassy and leo love island still together,kassy love island usa age,leo and kassy love island instagram,bergie and taylor love island,kassy and leo love island usa instagram,kassy and leo love island usa age,kassy and leo love island usa instagram account,kassy and leo love island usa instagram id,kassy and leo love island usa season 4,*kassy and leo love island usa,leo and ish kiss,leo loves kate" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As a result of his guilt, Leo was unable to fully commit to Kassy or Johnnie until the latter urged him to choose between them with a sad heart. Leo then made the decision to pursue Kassy. Knowing that Kassy was the only person in the villa for him at this point, he put all into trying to win her back. Kassy was hesitant to consider his approaches, but she couldn’t help but think about how much she loved Leo and wondered what she should do. She wanted to investigate her relationship with Matia, but she also got close to the new ‘Love Island UK’ star Scott van-der-Sluis and looked into Johnnie’s potential for romance.</p><p>Leo and Kassy’s relationship ultimately came down to the former’s choice made during the final recoupling ceremony. She was split between Scott, Johnnie, and Leo after calling it quits with Matia. She ultimately decided on Leo, much to Leo’s relief, saying that she could not deny their bond. Kassy and Leo undoubtedly won over many people, allowing them to become the runners-up of season 5 of “Love Island USA.” Perhaps it was the number of challenges the two had to overcome to be back together at last.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ubcedc2fec9f85b54790f47b53496585d><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Love Island USA Drama: Hannah and Marco's Current Status</span></a><h3>Are Kassy and Leo Still Together?</h3><p>Kassandra “Kassy” Castillo graciously accepted Leonardo “Leo” Dionicio’s proposal of marriage during their final on-screen date. While discussing the news with the other cast members, they were both over the moon and eagerly anticipating their time together. Despite the fact that neither of them has provided any official updates on the status of their relationship since their appearance on the show, all indications point to the possibility that they are still together.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Kassy Castillo (@kass.c)</a></p><p>Recently, Kassy posted a photo of herself and Leo on her Instagram story, with the latter kissing the former on the cheek, saying they will miss “Kaleo Island.” The location in question is where the couple’s final date occurred, and its name combines the names of the two reality TV stars. We wish them both the best and anticipate that their union will be successful in the years to come.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by LEONARDO DIONICIO (@leonardo_dionicio)</a></p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="love island usa season 5,carmen love island usa,kassy love island usa,hannah love island usa,kassy and leo love island still together,kassy love island usa age,leo and kassy love island instagram,bergie and taylor love island,kassy and leo love island usa instagram,kassy and leo love island usa age,kassy and leo love island usa instagram account,kassy and leo love island usa instagram id,kassy and leo love island usa season 4,*kassy and leo love island usa,leo and ish kiss,leo loves kate" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
