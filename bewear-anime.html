One day, she couldn't find Stufful, leaving her extremely dismayed. Unbeknownst to her, Stufful had been trapped under a fallen tree and was rescued by <a href=# title=Wicke>Wicke</a> of the <a href=# title="Aether Foundation">Aether Foundation</a>, who then took it to her workplace to recover.</p><p><a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> first met Bewear in <i><a href=# title=SM001>Alola to New Adventure!</a></i> after they got lost in a forest while chasing a <a href=# title="Grubbin (Pokémon)">Grubbin</a>. Ash and Pikachu greeted her with a smile, but panicked and ran off upon seeing Bewear destroying trees nearby in joy. Bewear eventually lost the two after <a href=# title="Guardian deities (anime)">Tapu Koko</a> distracted her, and she sighed sadly.</p><p>Bewear met <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a>, <a href=# title=James>James</a>, <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a>, and <a href=# title="Jessie's Wobbuffet">Wobbuffet</a> in <i><a href=# title=SM003>Loading the Dex!</a></i>, taking Jessie and James away from <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">battle</a> and to her den in the forest, while Meowth, Wobbuffet and <a href=# title="Jessie's Mimikyu">Mimikyu</a> followed them. In <i><a href=# title=SM004>First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style!</a></i>, after Jessie caught Mimikyu at the den, Bewear proceeded to give them some honey before heading off. A tribe of wild <a href=# title="Pikipek (Pokémon)">Pikipek</a> and <a href=# title="Trumbeak (Pokémon)">Trumbeak</a> soon came and stole all of the <a href=# title=Berry>Berries</a> in Bewear's den, so <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> agreed to not only catch the <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a>, but return the Berries to Bewear out of gratitude for giving Team Rocket food and shelter. When Bewear picked up Team Rocket to take them back to the den, they had only retrieved the Berries.</p><p>Bewear has since been seen dragging Team Rocket away from a battle before they could be sent blasting off, or even succeed in their plans.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM012>The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!</a></i>, <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> decided to use Bewear's den as their base of operations whilst in <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a>. They completed their new base in <i><a href=# title=SM018>A Seasoned Search!</a></i>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM090>Securing the Future!</a></i>, Bewear prevented the trio from interfering in the latest crisis to hit Alola. She later encouraged them to assist in showering <a href=# title="Necrozma (anime)">Necrozma</a> with light so it could return to its <a href=# title="List of Pokémon with form differences">normal form</a>.</p><p>When Bewear picked Team Rocket up from <a href=# title="Aether Paradise">Aether Paradise</a> in <i><a href=# title=SM096>Don't Ignore the Small Stufful!</a></i>, she was reunited with Stufful and took it with them.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/38/Pok%C3%A9_Problem_extra_scene_SM128.png/375px-Pok%C3%A9_Problem_extra_scene_SM128.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Bewear and Stufful enjoying their new hot springs<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM114>Beauty is Only Crystal Deep!</a></i>, Bewear found her den damaged after a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Pheromosa</a> attacked Jessie and James and stole their <a href=# title=Z-Crystal>Z-Crystals</a>. Later, she found Pheromosa battling Jessie, James, and the <a href=# title="Ultra Guardians">Ultra Guardians</a>. Seeing that Jessie, James, and Meowth were hurt, Bewear flew into a rage and attacked the <a href=# title="Ultra Beast">Ultra Beast</a>, easily defeating it. Afterwards, she retrieved the stolen Z-Crystals and took Team Rocket back to her den.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM122>Spying for the Big Guy!</a></i>, Team Rocket, having previously lied about having captured Bewear, learned that <a href=# title=Matori>Matori</a> was on her way to Alola to bring Bewear back to <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> with her. As a result, they attempted to <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">catch</a> Bewear, but she crushed the <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a> to dust. Later, when Team Rocket were attempting to catch <a href=# title="Grandpa Forest">Grandpa Forest</a>, Bewear and Stufful showed up and took the trio, along with Matori and her <a href=# title="Alolan form">Alolan</a> <a href=# title="Matori's Meowth">Meowth</a>, back to its den. That night, while Bewear was out swimming, Matori captured Stufful and was in the process of taking it back to Kanto when the trio intervened, distracting her and covertly substituting Stufful for Meowth. Soon after Matori realized this, Bewear broke through the window and rescued Meowth. Later, when Matori attempted to contact the trio, Bewear answered, which scared Matori. Bewear then crushed the communication device to dust.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM128>League Offenders and Defenders!</a></i>, it was revealed that Team Rocket had built a hot spring for Bewear and Stufful to keep them from spiriting them away during their participation in the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>, along with a robot modeled after <a href=# title="Oranguru (anime)">Oranguru</a> to tend to their needs. The plan was successful for the most part, as the mother and child spent the duration of the conference relaxing and spending quality time together. However, after the Oranguru robot broke down at the end of the conference in <i><a href=# title=SM139>Enter the Champion!</a></i>, Bewear had no reason to stay and began rushing over to <a href=# title="Manalo Stadium">Manalo Stadium</a> with Stufful to retrieve her guests. On her way there, Bewear saw an <a href=# title="Ultra Wormhole">Ultra Wormhole</a> forming over the stadium.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM140>Z-Move Showdown!</a></i>, Bewear arrived in Manalo Stadium to find Team Rocket about to be devoured by a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Guzzlord</a>. She saved the trio, but when Stufful was put in danger, Bewear turned her attention to defending her child. Guzzlord then started to land powerful blows on Bewear, much to Team Rocket's horror. Demonstrating how much they'd come to care for Bewear and Stufful, the trio abandoned their plans to steal the Pokémon competing in the Manalo Conference and used the mecha they were piloting to save Bewear and Stufful and carry them back to Melemele Island.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM146>Thank You, Alola! The Journey Continues!</a></i>, Team Rocket received an order from <a href=# title="Giovanni (anime)">Giovanni</a> to return to the <a href=# title="Team Rocket HQ (anime)">Team Rocket HQ</a>. Before departing, the trio thanked Bewear for her hospitality while in Alola and shared one last hug with her. Bewear then assisted their flight back to Kanto by hurling their balloon away. Bewear was later seen at her den, watching Stufful, Mimikyu, and <a href=# title="James's Mareanie">Mareanie</a> play.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN037>That New Old Gang of Mine!</a></i>, Bewear was seen in the forest, carrying some <a href=# title=Berry>Berries</a> alongside Mimikyu, Mareanie, and Stufful.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN076>All Out, All of the Time!</a></i>, Bewear was reunited with Team Rocket after they crash-landed in the hot spring next to her den.

As such, she developed a habit of rescuing them before they can be blasted off by <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his classmates</a>. She seems to have an uncanny ability to know Team Rocket's location, regardless of how far away they are. As such, she goes to astoundingly and unrealistically great lengths to ensure Team Rocket's safety, even going all the way to <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> to rescue them in one occasion. However, Bewear's rescues can also be unreliable; in <i><a href=# title=SM012>The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!</a></i>, Bewear "rescued" the trio just before they were going to defeat Ash and his Pokémon in a fair fight. She has also once taken Jessie away moments before she could get an autograph from <a href=# title=Oluolu>Oluolu</a>. Though they go to similarly great lengths to make sure they aren't rescued by her, Team Rocket has come to appreciate Bewear's hospitality, to the point where Jessie tried to share some malasadas with her, an act she would almost never do.</p><p>Bewear is extremely strong. This was best demonstrated in <i><a href=# title=SM061>A Mission of Ultra Urgency!</a></i>, when she encountered a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Buzzwole</a> and was able to hold her own against it. Thanks to her strength, she was also able to perform seemingly impossible feats, like jumping across rooftops in <i><a href=# title=SM006>A Shocking Grocery Run!</a></i>, flying through the air by using her legs as a propeller in <i><a href=# title=SM033>Big Sky, Small Fry!</a></i>, and running across the surface of the ocean from Kanto to Alola for at least three days in <i><a href=# title=SM043>When Regions Collide!</a></i>. Her strength was seen once again in <i><a href=# title=SM114>Beauty is Only Crystal Deep!</a></i>, where she was able to easily defeat a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Pheromosa</a> in battle.</p><p>Bewear enjoys hot springs and can be in them longer than normal humans and Pokémon, as seen in the <a href=# title="Poké Problem">Poké Problem</a> of <i><a href=# title=SM086>I Choose Paradise!</a></i>. Bewear's love of hot springs was seen again in <i><a href=# title=SM128>League Offenders and Defenders!</a></i>, when Team Rocket built her a hot spring outside her den. Bewear also enjoys putting on a display whilst in the hot spring, as seen in <i><a href=# title=SM131>The Battlefield of Truth and Love!</a></i>, where she and Stufful performed for a crowd that had gathered there.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_TCG>In the TCG</span></h2><p>Bewear is featured in the TCG.
