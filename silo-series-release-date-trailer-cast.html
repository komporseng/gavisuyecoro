These people do not know how long they've been underground, nor who built their safe haven. They do not even know why there is no life outside their silo. The only thing they're sure of: the silo is safe, and "out there", the outside world is not. Protected from the toxic and ruined environment of the decimated Earth's surface, the residents of the silo are bound by strict rules and regulations. However, when their very own sheriff breaks one of these cardinal rules and a series of unexplained deaths occur, questions start to arise within the underground community. Namely, silo engineer Juliette. Determined to find out what the true purpose of the silo is, Juliette begins to investigate, uncovering shocking secrets and the dark truth surrounding the mysterious silo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-in-the-cast-of-silo>Who Is in the Cast of Silo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/silo-david-oyelowo.png><p><strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong> (Dune) plays curious engineer Juliette.

The teaser begins with Tim Robbins, as Bernard, explaining just how sheltered the residents of the silo are. The community knows nothing about its origins or about why the outside world is uninhabitable. Despite this, the silo is shown to be a thriving and self-sufficient living space. A vast agricultural department including livestock exists within the silo, as does a NICU and a prison. Interestingly - and unlike a lot of post-apocalyptic television shows - it's clear to see that the people living within the silo aren't struggling to survive. Inside the silo, they have everything they could possibly need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the teaser shows that all is not well. Someone is seen preparing to go above ground, clad in protective overalls and a helmet. Another shot in the teaser shows the residents watching on an enormous screen as the person drops to their knees on the Earth's surface, frantically trying to remove their headgear. We also see Juliette beginning to question the strangeness of the silo. In a reflective moment, George asks Juliette the ultimate question: "What if everything you know to be true was one big lie?"</p><h2 id=when-and-where-can-you-watch-silo>When and Where Can You Watch Silo?</h2><p>After originally being in development as a feature film more than a decade ago, in May 2021 it was announced that Silo had instead received a series order consisting of ten episodes at Apple TV+. Alongside this news, it was also revealed that Rebecca Ferguson had been cast in the lead role. Over the following months, more cast members were disclosed, and filming for Silo began in August 2021. Shooting primarily took place in Hertfordshire, London, and wrapped in the spring of 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, it has been announced that the first two episodes of Silo will be available to watch on Apple TV+ on May 5, 2023, with the remaining eight episodes airing weekly thereafter. The show's finale will air on June 30, 2023.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple TV+ is available to purchase at $6.99 per month</a>, beginning with a seven-day free trial for new customers.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-background-of-silo>What Is the Background of Silo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silo_photo_010303.jpg><p>Silo is based on a series of post-apocalyptic sci-fi books of the same title by author <strong>Hugh Howey</strong>. Initially, Howey self-published his first book in the series, Wool, via Amazon as a stand-alone short story. However, the book's popularity soon skyrocketed, and Howey began to greatly expand upon his fictional universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At present, there are a total of three books in the series, the first being Wool, the second Shift, and the third being Dust. In August 2021, Howey announced that he had begun working on the as-yet-untitled fourth book in the series. Like the TV show, the book initially begins by following the story of the silo's sheriff, Holston. We believe the first season of Silo will follow the events of book one, Wool.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>'Wool': Harriet Walter, Avi Nash, and Chinaza Uche Join Apple TV+ Adaptation</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-the-creators-of-silo>Who Are the Creators of Silo?</h2><p>Silo was created for television by <strong>Graham Yost</strong> (Justified).

Writers include <strong>Ingrid Escajeda</strong> and <strong>Jeffery Wang</strong>, both of whom collaborated with Yost on Justified. In addition to starring as Juliette, Rebecca Ferguson also serves as an executive producer.
