She added that the bags might be “one of the best investments” that she’s made as they retain their value even when used. </span><span>Hermès’ </span><span>Birkin bags, the most desired and renowned of all luxury designer handbags, can retail anywhere from $9,000 to $500,000 each, according to </span><span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Business Insider.</span></a></span></li><li><span>Chua also clarified that everything she has now did not come from her ex-husband’s fortune.
