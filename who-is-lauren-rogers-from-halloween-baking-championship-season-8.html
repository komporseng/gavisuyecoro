One of the competitors, Lauren Rogers, wants to win the competition for her grandma because she encountered prejudice the previous year.</p><p>Gotti Sweets, a bakery owned by Lauren Roger, was spat upon in February 2021. The same month, someone spray-painted the N-word on a car parked in front of her shop, causing harm to her business. The competitor in the Halloween Baking Championship replied,</p><p>Rogers did not report the racist graffiti to the police because, like many others in her community, she was afraid of them. She stated:</p><p>You’ve been warned not to call the police because they might come and shoot you.</p><p>When Lauren posted a picture of the spray paint on Instagram, Olympia Police Officer Vasile Kovzun took note. He came back the following day and said he would look into what happened.</p><p>Additionally, the area’s foot patrols were increased by Officer Vasile and his coworkers. The fact that someone in their neighborhood did not trust the officers and instead decided to help Lauren astonished the officers. Rogers acknowledged their efforts and said:</p><p>I genuinely appreciate that; I hadn’t expected the city to respond in any way; I didn’t think people were paying that much attention.</p><h2><span id=Participant_in_the_Halloween_Baking_Competition_is_Lauren_Rogers>Participant in the Halloween Baking Competition is Lauren Rogers</span></h2><p>Lauren, who hails from Washington, is renowned for her custom cakes. She used to bake with her grandmother over the holidays, so she wants to win the competition to honor her. She makes one cake every hour on Saturdays, according to her Food Network bio.</p><p>She discovered her affinity for cake decorating during her brief time working at Baskin-Robbins. Lauren subsequently made the decision to pursue her interest professionally by enrolling in Portland, Oregon’s Le Cordon Bleu Western Culinary Institute.</p><p>In Olympia, Washington, she opened her own store in 2018 called Gotti Sweets. Custom-made cakes and Lauren’s “by appointment-custom-order-bakery” are well-known.</p><p>She has 15 years of experience baking cakes, cupcakes, pies, and cookies. Additionally, she provides her customers with cake by the slice, French macarons, peanut butter, and frosted molasses cookies. Pie Tots, which are little pastries encased in flaky pastry and filled with fruit, are the specialty of Lauren’s bakery.</p><h2><span id=The_eighth_Halloween_Baking_Championship_season>The eighth Halloween Baking Championship season</span></h2><p>The Halloween Baking Championship will include twelve competitors who will make spooky, terrifying, yet delectable treats for the judges.</p><p>The program, which will be judged by Stephanie Boswell, Carla Hall, and Zac Young, will be hosted by John Henson. The eerie motel where the cooks will be residing for the next eight weeks will be under Henson’s management.</p><p>Depending on the caliber of the sweets they produce, one or more bakers may be fired after each duty. Depending on the topic of the week, the bakers will perform two tasks in each episode. Food Network telecasts the Halloween Baking Championship every Monday at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Tomi Lahren</a></h3>Tomi Lahren estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
