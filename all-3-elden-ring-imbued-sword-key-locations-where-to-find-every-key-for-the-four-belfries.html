Each of the belfries will teleport you to a faraway place that is otherwise inaccessible, but like Stonesword Keys, Imbued Sword Keys break after use. That means you’ll need to find additional Imbued Sword Keys somewhere in The Lands Between in order to visit every location that The Four Belfries has to offer, but they’re quite rare. We’ve got your back with their locations though. Here’s where you can find all 3 Imbued Sword Keys in Elden Ring.</p><h2>What Are the Four Belfries in Elden Ring?</h2><p><strong>The Four Belfries</strong> are towers that will teleport you to different locations if you use an <strong>Imbued Sword Key</strong> to activate them. You can find The Four Belfries in the western half of <strong>Liurnia of the Lakes</strong> overlooking the western coast of the lake itself. You can see its exact location on the map below.</p><img title="All 3 Elden Ring Imbued Sword Key Locations: Where to Find Every Key for The Four Belfries" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Imbued-Sword-Key-Location-Four-Belfries.jpg alt=Imbued-Sword-Key-Location-Four-Belfries width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Of The Four Belfries, only three will teleport you to a different location. They don’t tell you exactly where they’ll take you, only giving you a cryptic message instead of a destination. The fourth belfry actually contains a chest with an Imbued Sword Key for you to use, so it doesn’t send you anywhere. The other three belfries transport you to the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>Precipice of Anticipation:&nbsp;</strong>Chapel of Anticipation</li><li><strong>Night Sky Unceasing:&nbsp;</strong>Nokron, Eternal City</li><li><strong>Crumbling Lands:&nbsp;</strong>Crumbling Farum Azula</li></ul><p>Of course, you can only visit one of them when you first arrive at The Four Belfries since you’ll only have one Imbued Sword Key, but the rest aren’t too far. Here’s where to find every Imbued Sword Key in Elden Ring.</p><h2>Four Belfries Imbued Sword Key Location</h2><p>The Imbued Sword Key at The Four Belfries can be found inside a <strong>chest</strong> at the <strong>top of the hill</strong> next to the fourth belfry. It’s the easiest one of the bunch to obtain by far. You can see its exact location on the map above.</p><img title="All 3 Elden Ring Imbued Sword Key Locations: Where to Find Every Key for The Four Belfries" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-Raya-Lucaria-Academy-Imbued-Sword-Key-Location.jpg alt=Elden-Ring-Raya-Lucaria-Academy-Imbued-Sword-Key-Location width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Raya Lucaria Academy Imbued Sword Key Location</h2><p>The second <strong>Imbued Sword Key</strong> can be found at the <strong>Raya Lucaria Academy</strong> just a short distance to the east of <strong>The Four Belfries</strong>. You can see its exact location on the map above. To reach it, teleport to the <strong>Debate Parlor Site of Grace</strong>. You will unlock this Site of Grace automatically after defeating the <strong>Red Wolf of Radagon</strong> boss. Exit the building to the north as if you were heading toward Rennala.</p><p>Once you reach the courtyard, <strong>turn left and climb up the rubble</strong> at the far wall. Then, <strong>continue up the stairs</strong> past the magic-casting enemies and <strong>jump over the rail to the left</strong> onto the stairs below. <strong>Continue up the short flight of stairs</strong> and<strong> turn left around the corner</strong> past yet another magic-casting enemy. <strong>Jump over the railing</strong> to the roof below.</p><p><strong>Continue straight</strong> across the roof until you reach the two enemies at the far end. Deal with them and then<strong> climb up the ladder</strong> on the tower on the right.&nbsp; At the top of the ladder, <strong>head straight down the narrow path</strong> and avoid the magic-casting enemies.</p><p>When you reach the tower at the end of the path, hug the wall and <strong>continue around the right side</strong>. Then, <strong>drop down</strong> to the roof below, and <strong>drop down yet again</strong> to the next roof below.<strong> Continue dropping down</strong> until you reach a <strong>narrow roof with an enemy on it</strong>. Kill the enemy and then <strong>drop down to the ledge on the right</strong>. You should see a <strong>glowing item</strong> at the end of the path if you’re going the right way. Continue forward and loot the corpse to obtain an <strong>Imbued Sword Key</strong>.</p><img title="All 3 Elden Ring Imbued Sword Key Locations: Where to Find Every Key for The Four Belfries" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-Sellia-Town-of-Sorcery-Imbued-Sword-Key-Location.jpg alt=Elden-Ring-Sellia-Town-of-Sorcery-Imbued-Sword-Key-Location width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Sellia, Town of Sorcery Imbued Sword Key Location</h2><p>The third <strong>Imbued Sword Key</strong> can be found in <strong>Sellia, Town of Sorcery</strong> in the center of the <strong>Caelid</strong> region. You can see its exact location on the map above. This one requires you to solve a puzzle in order to reach it. It’s locked behind a magic barrier, and you have to light 3 hidden braziers in order to break the spell and obtain your prize.</p><h3>Lighting the First Brazier</h3><p>The <strong>first brazier</strong> is located at the very <strong>northern end of town</strong> at the <strong>top of the stairs</strong> near the <strong>golden tree</strong> where you can find a <a href=#>Golden Seed</a>. There’s also a giant magic barrier nearby as well. From the golden tree, face <strong>southwest</strong>. Then,<strong> jump over the pots</strong> near the broken portion of the wall <strong>onto the giant tree branch</strong>. Carefully <strong>tread across the branch</strong> and <strong>jump onto the tower</strong> on the right with all the red spots covering the ledge. <strong>Climb the ladder</strong> and the brazier is at the top of the tower.</p><h3>Lighting the Second Brazier</h3><p>From the first brazier, proceed <strong>back down to the tree branch</strong>,&nbsp;and jump over to the <strong>red-roofed building</strong> on the right. Then, <strong>summon Torrent</strong> and use his <strong>double jump</strong> to climb onto the <strong>higher part</strong> of the same building. It’s a tricky jump, but you can only reach the higher roof with Torrent. Once you’re up there,<strong> face southeast and jump</strong> onto the <strong>giant tree branch</strong> across the road. Use Torrent’s double jump to guide your landing.</p><p>Continue across the roof to the <strong>east</strong> and then jump across the <strong>short gap</strong> to the following roof. Then, use Torrent’s double jump to <strong>climb onto the taller roof</strong> to your left. Next, jump across the <strong>short gap to the east</strong> to the next roof. Finally, use Torrent’s double jump to climb onto the <strong>first ledge of the tower</strong>. When you make it onto the tower ledge,<strong> dismount Torrent</strong> and walk slowly around to the other side. Climb the <strong>ladder</strong> and you’ll find the <strong>second brazier</strong> at the top.</p><h3>Lighting the Third Brazier</h3><p>From the second brazier, <strong>climb down</strong> the ladder and slowly make your way across the <strong>twisted tree branch</strong> to the <strong>southwest</strong>. Continue all the way down the branch until you reach a <strong>rooftop</strong>. Run <strong>west</strong> along the rooftop and use the s<strong>mall bridge-like roof</strong> to cross to the next buildling. Be careful when jumping from the thin part to the roof, it’s a tricky jump. Climb the <strong>ladder</strong> and you’ll find the <strong>final brazier</strong> at the top.</p><p>With all three braziers lit, the magic barrier is now gone. Head to the <strong>northeast corner of Sellia</strong> and you’ll find a <strong>chest</strong> tucked away in a small part of a building. Open the chest to reveal the third and final <strong>Imbued Sword Key</strong> in Elden Ring.</p><p><strong>Elden Ring&nbsp;</strong>is available now on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZpqknGKAbrHLnZynZaKeu6h5yKaZrp2UYsC4u9GdZKSdqWK5sK%2FAraCopqNixKmx0Z5kraddm7avsIyerZ6qqWK4psWMn6arZaSdsm6yzq6pZpqVobOztcSsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brooklyn-detention-complex-on-fast-track-to-shut-down-for-new-jail-union.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brooklyn Detention Complex on fast track to shut down for new jail: union</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tommyinnit-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>TommyInnit Net Worth: YouTube Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
