He is <strong>62 years old</strong> and is under the astrological sign, Aquarius. He holds American nationality and his full name is Troyal Garth Brooks.</p><p>His father’s name is Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr. and his mother’s name is Colleen McElroy Carroll.

And he has other four half-siblings and their names are Jim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy.</p><p>Moreover, Garth Brooks often sang in casual family settings when he was a child, however, his primary focus was athletics. He was able to play football and baseball and ran track and field in high school. He also received a track scholarship to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he was able to compete in the javelin. Brooks formed his band, Santa Fe, learning to play whatever the college audience wanted when he worked as a bouncer at night at a local bar. In the year 1984, he graduated with a degree in advertising.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187615 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garth-Brooks-Friend.jpg alt="Garth Brooks" width=650 height=648 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187615 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Garth Brooks along with his friends (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Garth_Brooks_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Garth Brooks – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Garth Brooks started his professional music career, singing and playing guitar in Oklahoma clubs and bars, most notably Wild Willie’s Saloon in Stillwater in the year 1985. And, although he listened to some country music, he was most fond of rock music. However, in the year 1981, after hearing “Unwound”, he decided that he was more interested in playing country music. Then, finally, in the year 1985, entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from Dallas to listen to Brooks and he liked what he heard and offered to produce the first demo.</p><p>Garth’s eponymous first album was released in the year 1989 and was a chart success most of the album was traditionalist country, influenced in part by George Strait. He then released his second album the next year which spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. This album eventually became his highest-selling album. Soon after he released his third album as well which was a huge success as well. This album’s musical content was a melange of country pop and honky-tonk. Likewise, Garth became the first country artist with three albums listed in the Billboard 200’s top 20 in one week. He then released many other albums as well as singles throughout his career.</p><p>Likewise, his first world tour started in the year 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. And, his sold-out venues like Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre and London’s Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He even started the London radio station, Country 1035. Garth even took his World Tour to other regions throughout Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. Moreover, following the release of “Fresh Horses”, he embarked on his second world tour. And, the tour’s total attendance, approximately 5.5 million, ranks third on the all-time list of concert attendance, and its gross of over $105 million ranks it among the highest-grossing concert tours in the 1990s.</p><h4>More About Career</h4><p>Garth Brooks took on the persona of “Chris Gaines”, a fictitious rock-and-roll musician and character for an upcoming film titled The Lamb in the year 1999. He even appeared as Gaines in a television mockumentary for the VH1 series Behind the Music and as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, which he also hosted as himself. However, his rock-and-roll music didn’t do good and didn’t impress the audience.</p><p>Moreover, as his career flourished, Garth seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in the year 1992, and then again in 1995, but each time returned to touring. Then, on October 26, 2000, he officially announced his retirement from recording and performing. His final album before retirement, “Scarecrow” did not match the sales levels of Brooks’ heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts.</p><p>Then, in the year 2005, he expressed his interest in returning to live performances; but remained adamant about the premise of not releasing new music until the year 2014. Likewise, in November 2005, he along with Walmart issued an updated “The Limited Series” compilation. It is a box set containing reissues of Brooks’ albums. He was able to take a brief break from retirement early in 2005 to perform in various benefit concerts. Moreover, even after his retirement he was constantly releasing his re-recording and re-issuing and was entertaining his audiences. And, he even performed the shows.</p><p>Also, after years of royalty disputes and opposition to online music streaming, Garth launched a streaming channel on Sirius XM Radio. He even reached an agreement to stream his entire catalog via Amazon Music.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187614 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Garth-Brooks-Concert.jpg alt="Garth Brooks" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187614 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Garth performing in front of the audience (Source: Instagram)</p><h4>Present Time and More</h4><p>Garth released a new single, “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">All Day Long</a>“, the first off his 2020 album, Fun in the year 2018.
