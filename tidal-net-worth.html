Gradually the number of its users increased, and Tidal was made available also for Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg and Belgium as well, slowly expanding across Europe. According to their reports, Tidal can now be used in 52 countries worldwide.</p><p>The service has more than 48.5 million tracks and 175,000 music videos on its server, but apparently because of the high subscription fees, the service has only three million users, half of another music service, Deezer. However, the higher fees have enabled its creators to offer higher payment on royalties for musicians, but also offer high fidelity, lossless audio quality.</p><p>Back in January 2015, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> bought Aspiro for $56.2 million, and a year and a half later Aspiro closed its offices in Stockholm and terminated all contracts, including with CEO Andy Chen.</p><p>However, now the new owner of Aspiro, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> has appointed Peter Tonstad as the new Aspiro CEO, and in September the same year, his Tindal service started selling CDs and digital downloads.</p><p>Just several months later, Jeff Toig became the new CEO of Tidal, but left the company in March 2017. However, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, now wanting to increase the popularity of his own music service, started a mass-campaign and held a press conference, during which he presented a number of famed musicians as co-owners of the streaming service. The list included Coldplay, Arcade Fire, <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, Daft Punk, <a href=#>Jack White</a>, <a href=#>Alicia Keys</a> and others, while over the last couple of years, several more have joined, including rapper T.I., then <a href=#>Lil Wayne</a> and others, while <a href=#>Kanye West</a> was dismissed from Tidal, following his disagreement over finances with the board of directors.</p><p>In order to increase the quality of the music Tidal offers to its customers, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> as the owner of the firm has managed a deal with the UK company Master Quality Authenticated, after which Tidal now offers 96 kHz/24 bit quality audio, and is the only streaming service to offer such high quality.</p><p>Thanks to its increasing popularity, numerous musicians have released their material on Tidal, and the royalties they receive are three times worth those they get through Spotify. Also, in January 2017, Sprint, the US mobile carrier bought 33% of the stakes for $200 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjq2gnZmcYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./young-mazino.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Young Mazino Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pele-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pele Net Worth, Bio, Wiki, Education, Height, Family, Career, Personal life And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./doria-ragland.html>Doria Ragland - Bio, Age, Height, In Relation, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ashley-hess.html>Ashley Hess</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ben-phillips.html>Ben Phillips - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helen-gamboa.html>Helen Gamboa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./oh-ji-hwan.html>Oh Ji-hwan</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe.
