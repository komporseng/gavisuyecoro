He was well-known for directing films such as Raven Hawk, Mean Guns, Crazy Six, Postmortem, and others.&nbsp;Cynthia Curnan, his wife, paid homage to him on Facebook, writing:</p><p>“Albert Pyun died at 5:50 p.m. on Saturday, November 26. I stayed with him until he took his last breath, which sounded like he was shedding the weight of the world.”</p><p>Curnan claimed that Pyun has long battled dementia and multiple sclerosis. She also set up a GoFundMe campaign to fund the costs of his memorial service in Kailua, Hawaii. The page, which has so far raised $625, seeks to raise $1,00000.</p><h2>Captain America was directed by Albert Pyun in 1990.</h2><p>Captain America was released on July 22, 1992, and made around $3 million at the movie office. Although it garnered unfavorable reviews at first, it eventually gained popularity and became a cult classic.&nbsp;Steve Rogers/Captain America was played by Matt Salinger. Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin, Michael Nouri, Melinda Dillon, Kim Gillingham, and Scott Paulin rounded out the cast.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Albert-Pyun-1.jpg alt="Albert Pyun" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The plot revolved around Steve Rogers, who transforms into a super soldier and battles the Red Skull. He is buried under the ice, however, and awakens in the 1940s, when he is assigned to defend the President of the United States.&nbsp;The film, directed by Albert Pyun, did not have a sequel. Instead, the character was incorporated into the MCU, with Chris Evans debuting as Steve Rogers in Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011.&nbsp;Evans played the same character in six more films till Avengers: Endgame in 2019.</p><p></p><h2>Albert Pyun directed numerous financially successful films.</h2><p>Albert Pyun, born on May 19, 1953, began his career as a commercial editor before moving to Los Angeles to pursue his passion for becoming a director.&nbsp;The Sword and the Sorcerer, his directorial debut, was a box-office hit. He went on to direct films such as Total Recall, Radioactive Dreams, Dangerously Close, Alien from L.A., and Cyborg.&nbsp;He rose to prominence in the 1990s for his work on the NBC sitcom The Fifth Corner. He directed the 2005 action picture Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon, which received negative reviews. Instead, the picture gained notoriety by being embroiled in various legal complications over its funding.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Albert-Pyun-2.jpg alt="Albert Pyun" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In 2008, he made a return with the action-fantasy film Road to Hell, which won multiple awards at the PollyGrind Film Festival in 2012.
