So, that includes one of the blink-and-you-might-miss-him characters, Johnny, played by actor Sebastien Amoruso.</p><p>The actor is completely brand-new to the world of showbiz and so this Sebastian Amoruso Wiki is a never-before-covered story of him.</p><h3><strong>Sebastian Amoruso On “I Know What You Did Last Summer”</strong></h3><p>I Know What You Did Last Summer is a series reboot and a modern take on the hit 1997 slasher film of the same name.</p><p>The eight-episode series dropped on Amazon Prime on 15 October 2021. Although the series has the same premise as the movie adaptation there is a whole new bunch of fresh-faced actors taking on the title roles. This much-hyped new sequel is also not the continuation of its original series.</p><p>The plot develops after a fatal car accident. After covering up a hit and run, a group of teenager friends is stalked the following summer by a serial killer who mercilessly taunts them off one-by-one.</p><p>The TV show’s friend circle is comprised of twins Lennon and Alison (actor <a href=#>Madison Iseman</a>), rich girl Margot (actor Brianne Tju), Nice Guy Dylan (actor Ezekiel Goodman), Riley (Ashley Moore), and Johnny, played by Sebastian of course.</p><p>Sebastian, here, plays gay best friend Johnny. This will likely be the first time most audiences have ever seen him. The horror film, therefore, has been his stage to some much-needed exposure in the industry.</p><p>Sebastian and the other new bunch of fresh-faced actors in the show have taken on these title roles hoping the project would give them the kind of fame the iconic duo Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. received in the original cult teen film.</p><h3><strong>Sebastian Amoruso Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Sebastian Amoruso reached the age of 22 sometime before October 2021.</p><h3><strong>Does Sebastian Amoruso Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Until October 2021, there was no legit information about Sebastian Amoruso having a girlfriend.</p><p>That been said, there are still rumors that Sebastian’s partner is Madeline Rae whom you may find on her Instagram @madelineraeheyman. As per her profile on it, Madeline is a BFA student at USC.</p><p>Judging from this couple of times Sebastian and Madeline shared their moments on social media, fans have it suspecting that maybe they dated once.</p><h3><strong>Sebastian Amoruso Family</strong></h3><p>Sebastian Amoruso listed his sister Izzy Amoruso, father Paul Amoruso, and aunt Lisa Chang as his family members on Facebook.</p><p>His father is from Wayland, Massachusetts, he now lives in Washington D.C. and works at HIIP Nutritional Fitness.</p><p>Sebastian’s sister, like him, was born and bred in Washington D.C. Seemingly youngest, the sister went to Walnut Hill School for the Arts.</p><p>Then, Sebastian’s mom, whom we also found on Facebook, is named Sally Amoruso. The matriarch is a chief partner officer at EAB. She studied at Wharton Graduate School of Business, University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University is from Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>Having lived in Washington D.C. and Boca Raon in Florida in the past, Sebastian is now (2021) based in Los Angeles, California.</p><h3><strong>Sebastian Amoruso Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Sebastian Amoruso had above an estimated $100 thousand net worth until October 2021.</p><p>Having only starred in a series Solve in 2020 and I Know What You Did Last Summer in 2021, Sebastian is a fresh-faced actor. However, we have no doubt this is just the beginning for the aspiring star.</p><p>He is represented by Brookside Artist Management and the CESD talent agency.</p><p>Sebastian who also plays guitar studied at Berklee College of Music.</p><p>So you know, Sebastian did the role of Wes in the Snapchat original series Solve in a 2020 episode.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Sebastian Amoruso?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Sebastian Amoruso stands to a height of 5 feet 9 inches or 1.75 meters.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Sebastian Amoruso On TikTok?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Sebastian Amoruso could not be found on TikTok until at least 16 October 2021.</p><p>However, he was on Instagram at handle <a href=#>@sebastianamoruso</a>.
