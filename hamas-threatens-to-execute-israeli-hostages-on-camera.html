into a desperate race to find and free them as the terror group threatened Monday to execute captives.</p><p>Israeli authorities have not yet provided specific details about the number and identities of the kidnapped victims, but a preliminary assessment shared by one senior military official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the New York Times</a> suggests at least 150 people have been captured.</p><p>Among them are 5-year-old Raz and 3-year-old Aviv, their devastated father, Yoni Asher, revealed Monday.</p><p>Asher’s entire world came crashing down Saturday when he recognized his girls and their mother in a video circulating on social media showing abducted Israelis being forced onto a flatbed truck, surrounded by men with guns.</p><p>He had last spoken to his wife, Doron Asher Katz, 34, earlier that day when she phoned him from her mom’s place in southern Israel, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg.</a></p><p>“She told me terrorists had infiltrated&nbsp;the home,” he told the outlet.&nbsp;“The phone got disconnected.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Hostages being held by Hamas

and her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, were at a music festival near the Gaza border when gunmen attacked the site, murdering hundreds. <span class=credit>Facebook</span></figure><p>It’s not clear where the terrorist group is hiding the scores of people it brutally snatched. Gaza may be a tiny strip of land under heavy surveillance that’s hemmed in by the Israel Defense Forces, but it remains somewhat opaque to Israeli intelligence agencies, experts said.</p><p>There’s little question, however, that those kidnapped — who also include Israeli soldiers, elderly people and women — are in imminent and extraordinary danger.</p><p>On Monday, Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades, the terrorist group’s military arm, chillingly declared it would begin killing its prisoners if the Israeli government continues bombing Palestinian lands.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The gunmen captured Argamani, 25, as her boyfriend looked on. <span class=credit>Facebook</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Argamani pleaded with her abductors not to kill her.

Please do something to force Hamas to release them alive!,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she pleaded as she broke down in tears</a>.</p><p>“This is unprecedented — nothing like this has happened before.
